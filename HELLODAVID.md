# HELLO DAVID!

- I'm not sure if my typing of the cocktails was done properly, but that's the best I could come up with.
- I had the error on console: cocktails.map is not a function at Cocktails (Cocktails.tsx:22:21);
- Took me a long time to figure out what was wrong with it, but chatgpt helped. I wouldn't have figure it out on my own.
